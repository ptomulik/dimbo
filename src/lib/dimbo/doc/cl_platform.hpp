 * \defgroup Dimbo_Cl_Platform Dimbo OpenCL platform layer
 * \brief C++ wrappers for accessing OpenCL platform layer (retrieving
 *        information about available OpenCL platforms and devices).
 *
 * <h3 class="groupheader">Overwiev</h3>
 *
 *
 * This module provides access to OpenCL platform layer described by the
 * <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/">OpenCL specification</a>
 * under chapter 4 "The OpenCL Platform Layer". %Dimbo exposes this
 * functionality in an object oriented way. Most calls are simplified, memory
 * management is handled by the library, OpenCL errors are turned-out into
 * %Dimbo CL exceptions (see \ref Dimbo::Cl::Exception). All the stuff is made
 * type-safe.
 *
 * <h3 class="groupheader">Location in source tree</h3>
 *
 *
 * The code providing core functionality is found in <b>src/lib/dimbo/cl/</b>
 * directory. There is also an amount of associated code scattered over the
 * other directories, for example generic swig interface files for the OpenCL
 * functionality (\c src/lib/dimbo/swig/dimbo/cl/), python-specific swig
 * interface files for the OpenCL functionality 
 * (\c src/lib/dimbo/python/dimbo/cl/) etc.
 *
 * <h3 class="groupheader">Contents</h3>
 *
 *
 * The %Dimbo OpenCL platform layer provides these classes:
 *    - platform/device proxy (Dimbo::Cl::Platform and Dimbo::Cl::Device),
 *    - platform/device collections (Dimbo::Cl::Platforms and Dimbo::Cl::Devices) and,
 *    - entire platform layer (Dimbo::Cl::Platform_Layer).
 *
 * The Dimbo::Cl::Platform object is used to send queries to single OpenCL
 * platform (via \c clGetPlatformInfo()). The Dimbo::Cl::Device is used to send
 * queries to single OpenCL device (via \c clGetDeviceInfo()). The
 * Dimbo::Cl::Platform and Dimbo::Cl::Device objects are lightweight - each of
 * them stores only its platform/device identifier.
 *
 * The whole OpenCL platform layer (OpenCL platforms and devices available
 * locally to the current process) is represented by Dimbo::Cl::Platform_Layer
 * object. The Dimbo::Cl::Platform_Layer provides convenient way to query
 * multiple platforms/devices at once (see \ref
 * querying_cl_platform_with_platform_layer_object "the example").
 *
 * \anchor querying_cl_platform_by_hand
 * <h3 class="groupheader">Querying OpenCL platforms/devices in a straightforward way</h3>
 *
 *
 * Platforms/devices may be queried by using Dimbo::Cl::Platform and
 * Dimbo::Cl::Device objects. A straightforward recipe to gather some
 * information "by-hand" may be:
 *    -# Create a collection of Platform objects:
 *        \snippet cl_platform3.cpp Create_Platforms
 *    -# Iterate over the platforms,
 *       \snippet cl_platform3.cpp Iterate_Platforms
 *       and query each platform for the necessary information, e.g (the code
 *       within our custom query_platform functor):
 *       \snippet cl_platform3.cpp Query_Platform_Info
 *    -# For each platform, retrieve its Devices,
 *       \snippet cl_platform3.cpp Retrieve_Platform_Devices
 *       then iterate over these devices
 *       \snippet cl_platform3.cpp Iterate_Platform_Devices
 *       and query each device for device information, e.g. (the code within
 *       our custom query_device functor):
 *       \snippet cl_platform3.cpp Query_Device_Info
 *
 *
 * The complete code for the above example may be found in \ref
 * cl_platform3.cpp. Note, that this is suboptimal (you've just see the
 * boilerplate related to iteration and manual querying). The better, and more
 * flexible approach is described below.
 *
 * \anchor querying_cl_platform_with_platform_layer_object
 * <h3 class="groupheader">Querying OpenCL platforms/devices using Dimbo::Cl::Platform_Layer</h3>
 *
 * An instance of Dimbo::Cl::Platform_Layer represents (locally available)
 * OpenCL platforms and their devices. It supports retrieval and enumeration of
 * (all) local platforms and devices. The object is intended to cooperate with
 * other types in %Dimbo, such as these defined in module named \ref Dimbo_Clinfo.
 *
 * The information describing all the OpenCL platforms and devices referred
 * by a Dimbo::Cl::Platform_Layer object may be easily encapsulated within an
 * instance of Dimbo::Clinfo::Platform_Layer_Info. Querying all the information
 * and storing it with Dimbo::Clinfo::Platform_Layer_Info is as simple as
 * single call to Dimbo::Cl::query_platform_layer_info().
 * 
 * With the help of %Dimbo data streaming utilities, code for dumping
 * properties of all locally available OpenCL platforms and devices may be
 * reduced to a single line:
 *
 * \snippet cl_platform0.cpp Query_Print_Info
 *
 * The complete example is found in \ref cl_platform0.cpp. More instructions
 * may be found in a module named \ref Dimbo_Clinfo.
