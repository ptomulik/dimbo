  Virtually each engineering discipline is equipped with a computer software
  supporting design and analysis in that field. In the scope of multibody
  system dynamics one can count at least seven commercial packages suitable for
  the simulation and analysis of mechanisms. Each one provides its own
  procedures for analysis and optimization as well as database formats used to
  store models.
  </p>

  <p>
  In multidisciplinary projects, or projects conducted by collaborating groups,
  it sometimes happens that two or more independently prepared models have to
  be analysed jointly as a single system. As long as models are compatible with
  some common simulation package, they may be merged into single model and
  loaded by that tool for analysis. Things become more difficult when models
  are incompatible. For related disciplines, such as the multibody system
  dynamics with finite element analysis or control systems, one can utilize
  predefined co-simulation interfaces provided by the engineering packages.
  Such interfaces usually support single counterpart software. Extending
  simulation environment to allow free interaction between N incompatible tools
  requires Nx(N-1) interfaces to be developed

  DIMBO follows some design principles of
  <a href="http://www.mpcci.de/mpcci-software.html">MpCCI</a> where the
  computational environment may be split into two layers such that the lower
  layer contains simulators with their adapters, whereas the higher layer
  provides a service responsible for synchronization/coupling.

  Computational codes interfaced by DIMBO are assumed to represent multibody
  subsystems. First supported code is our in-house routine for rigid multibody
  systems based on OpenCL. In general, two kinds of computational codes are
  assumed to be supported at some point:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>routines which evaluate equations of motion at prescribed time instants,</li>
    <li>simulators which integrate by their own the underlying differential equations.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  The resultant computational algorithm is a kind of distributed integrator of
  Differential Algebraic Equations. It's iterative and it's based on methods
  known as dynamic iteration or waveform relaxation. Especially tailored to
  subsystem coupled by constraints is the waveform-Newton algorithm.
