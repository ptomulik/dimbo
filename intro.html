  <p>
  DIMBO project supports our development of novel methods for modeling and
  analysis of general constrained multibody systems. The scope of the project
  includes strategies for co-simulation (restricted to multibody systems) and
  implementation of efficient algorithms on GPU-based platform
  <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/intro/opencl_backend.html">(OpenCL backend)</a>. To allow
  experimenting with certain parts of DIMBO code we provide bindings to
  scripting languages (currently Python is supported).
