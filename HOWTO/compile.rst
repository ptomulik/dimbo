HOWTO: Compile DIMBO project

compiler::

    CCFLAGS='-g -O2' CXXFLAGS='-std=c++11' CFLAGS='' scons

HOWTO: Compile with clang compiler
``````````````````````````````````

You may use clang_ compiler instead of the default one (gcc)::

    CC=clang CXX=clang++ scons

You may also wish to delete ``build/`` directory and scons cache files::

    rm -r build/ .scon*

HOWTO: Compile API documentation
````````````````````````````````
